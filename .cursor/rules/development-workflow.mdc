# Development Workflow

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   cd backend && npm install
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables in both `backend/` and `frontend/` directories

3. Run database migrations:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   npm run migrate
   ```

## Development Commands

### Backend Development

```sh
cd backend
npm run dev          # Start with file watching
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript
npm start           # Run production build
npm test            # Run tests with Vitest
```

### Frontend Development

```sh
cd frontend
npm run dev         # Start Vite dev server
npm run build       # Build for production
npm run preview     # Preview production build
npm run lint        # Run ESLint
npm test            # Run tests with Vitest
```

### Database Operations

```sh
cd backend
npm run migrate     # Apply migrations
npx prisma generate # Generate Prisma client
npx prisma studio   # Open Prisma Studio
```

## Testing

- Backend: Vitest for unit tests
- Frontend: Vitest + Playwright for E2E tests
- Run tests: `npm test` in respective directories

## Code Quality

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint for code linting
- Consistent code formatting
- Comprehensive error handling

## Deployment

- Backend: Node.js server with compiled TypeScript
- Frontend: Static files served by Vite
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma migrations
- File storage: Supabase integration
